#### Install - execute this once. 

```python
%pip install jupysql --upgrade duckdb-engine pandas --quiet
```

#### Load the data

```python
from urllib.request import urlretrieve
from zipfile import ZipFile
import pandas as pd

url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/445/absenteeism+at+work.zip"

# download the file
urlretrieve(url, "./raw-data/Absenteeism_at_work_AAA.zip")

# Extract the CSV file
with ZipFile("./raw-data/Absenteeism_at_work_AAA.zip", "r") as zf:
    zf.extractall("./raw-data/")

# Check the extracted CSV file name
# (in this case, it's "Absenteeism_at_work.csv")
csv_file_name = "./raw-data/Absenteeism_at_work.csv"

# Data clean up
df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_name, sep=",")
df.columns = df.columns.str.replace(" ", "_")

# Save the cleaned up CSV file
df.to_csv("Absenteeism_at_work_cleaned.csv", index=False)
```

#### Load Engine

<b>Note</b> Ensure you restart any previous notebook that has the same database name as the one initialized below.

```python
%reload_ext sql
%sql duckdb:///absenteeism.duck.db
```

```sql
create or replace table absenteeism as
from read_csv_auto('Absenteeism_at_work_cleaned.csv', header=True, sep=';')
```

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM absenteeism
```

#### Use JupySQL to perform the queries and answer the questions.

Example: show the first 5 rows.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM absenteeism 
LIMIT 5
```

#### Question 1.1 (Easy):
How many records are there in the 'absenteeism' table? 


<!-- #region -->
<details>

<summary>Answers</summary>

You can use the `%%sql` magic and the `COUNT(*)` function to count the total number of records. 

```python
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM absenteeism
```
</details>
<!-- #endregion -->

#### Question 1.2 (Easy):
How many unique employees are listed in the dataset?



<!-- #region -->
<details>

<summary>Answers</summary>

You can use the `%%sql` magic and the `COUNT(DISTINCT ID)` function to count the total number of unique instances of the `Age` column. 

```python
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ID) 
FROM absenteeism;
```
</details>
<!-- #endregion -->

#### Question 1.3 (Easy):
What is the average distance from residence to work? 


<!-- #region -->
<details>

<summary>Show Answers</summary>

You can use the `%%sql` magic and the `AVG(Distance_from_Residence_to_Work)` function to calculate the average distance from residence to work.. 

```python
%%sql
SELECT AVG(Distance_from_Residence_to_Work) 
FROM absenteeism;
```
</details>
<!-- #endregion -->

#### Question 2.1 (Medium):
On which days of the week does the average absenteeism time exceed 4 hours? 


<!-- #region -->
<details>

<summary>Answers</summary>

You can use the `%%sql` magic and break down the query as follows:

1. Select the column with name `Day_of_the_week`
2. From the table called `absenteeism`
3. Then group the values by day of the week that have an average value (use `AVG`) of more than 4 hours in absenteeism. 

```python
%%sql
SELECT Day_of_the_week 
FROM absenteeism 
GROUP BY Day_of_the_week 
HAVING AVG(Absenteeism_time_in_hours) > 4;
```
</details>
<!-- #endregion -->

#### Question 2.2 (Medium):
What is the average transportation expense for each season?


<!-- #region -->
<details>

<summary>Answers</summary>

You can use the `%%sql` magic and. Use the `AVG(Transportation_expense)` with the alias `AVG_Transportation_Expense` function to count the average transporation expense, then group by seasons.

```python
%%sql
SELECT Seasons, AVG(Transportation_expense) AS AVG_Transportation_Expense
FROM absenteeism 
GROUP BY Seasons;

```
</details>
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region -->
#### Question 2.3 (Medium):


What is the average absenteeism time for employees with BMI higher than the average BMI
<!-- #endregion -->


<!-- #region -->
<details>

<summary>Show Answers</summary>

You can use the `%%sql` magic and. Use the `AVG(Absenteeism_time_in_hours)` with the alias `AVG_Absenteeism_time_in_hours` function to count the average absenteeism (time units hours). 

`WHERE Body_mass_index > (`: This part begins a condition that the data must meet to be included in our average calculation. Here, we're only interested in rows where the `Body_mass_index` is greater than a certain value.

`SELECT AVG(Body_mass_index) FROM absenteeism)`: This is a subquery, a query within a query. It's calculating the average `Body_mass_index` for the entire absenteeism table.

```python
%%sql
SELECT AVG(Absenteeism_time_in_hours) as AVG_Absenteeism_time_in_hours
FROM absenteeism 
WHERE Body_mass_index > (
    SELECT AVG(Body_mass_index) 
    FROM absenteeism);

```
</details>
<!-- #endregion -->

#### Question 3.1 (Hard):
Find the top 3 ages with the highest total absenteeism hours, excluding disciplinary failures.



<!-- #region -->


<details>

<summary>Answers</summary>

You can use the `%%sql` magic and break down the query as follows:

1. Select the column with name `Age`, compute the Sum of `Absenteeism_time_in_hours`. Give this sum an alias `Sum_Absenteeism`.
2. From the table called `absenteeism`
3. The keywork WHERE is used to filter the data that meets a specific condition, in this case `Disciplinary_failure` is equal to zero.
4. Group values by the `Age` column.
5. Sort the values by the sum and show the first 3 values.

```python
%%sql
SELECT Age, SUM(Absenteeism_time_in_hours) AS Sum_Absenteeism
FROM absenteeism 
WHERE Disciplinary_failure = 0 
GROUP BY Age 
ORDER BY Sum_Absenteeism
DESC LIMIT 3;
```
</details>
<!-- #endregion -->

#### Question 3.2 (Hard):

Find the age of employees who have been absent for more than 5 hours with an unjustified absence.

Hint: investigate encoding on the data source.


<!-- #region -->
<details>

<summary>Answers</summary>

You can use the `%%sql` magic. 'Unjustified absence' is coded with 26. From there all that is required is selecting the age, and using `WHERE` to set up the appropriate conditions. 

```python
%%sql
SELECT Age 
FROM absenteeism 
WHERE Reason_for_absence = 26 AND Absenteeism_time_in_hours > 5;

```
</details>
<!-- #endregion -->

#### Question 3.3 (Hard):

Which reasons for absence are more frequent for social drinkers than social non-drinkers?


<!-- #region -->
<details>

<summary>Show Answers</summary>

You can use the `%%sql` magic. We use `SELECT` to extract the `Reason_for_absence` from the `absenteeism` table. 

The column `Social_drinker` is encoded using binary notation, 0=is not a social drinker, 1=is a social drinker. 

We next group by their reason for absence. 

`HAVING COUNT() > (`  begins the condition that the groups must meet to be included in the results. Only groups where the count of rows (representing the number of instances of each `Reason_for_absence` among social drinkers) is greater than a certain value will be included.

`SELECT COUNT() FROM absenteeism WHERE Social_drinker = 0 GROUP BY Reason_for_absence)`  is a subquery that calculates the count of rows for each `Reason_for_absence` where `Social_drinker` is 0 (indicating the employee is not a social drinker), effectively giving us the number of instances of each `Reason_for_absence` among non-social drinkers.

```python
%%sql
SELECT Reason_for_absence 
FROM absenteeism 
WHERE Social_drinker = 1 
GROUP BY Reason_for_absence 
HAVING COUNT() > (
    SELECT COUNT() 
    FROM absenteeism 
    WHERE Social_drinker = 0 
    GROUP BY Reason_for_absence);

```
