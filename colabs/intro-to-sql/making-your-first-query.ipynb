    "\n",
    "The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls.

    "12. campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric)\n",
    "13. pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)\n",
    "14. previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)\n",
    "15. poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')\n",
    "16. y: has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')\n",
