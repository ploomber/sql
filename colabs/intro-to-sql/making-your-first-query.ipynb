    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is the widely adopted language used for managing and manipulating data. It's the language that inspired its other popular variants you may have heard of, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn how to make your first SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform your first SQL query, we will be working with one main dataset throughout this course:\n",

    "\n",
    "The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. \n",

    "The data contains the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. age (numeric)\n",

    "6. housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')\n",

    "9. month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')\n",
    "10. day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')\n",
    "11. duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric)\n",
    "12. campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric)\n",
    "13. pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)\n",
    "14. previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)\n",
    "15. poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')\n",

    "To summarize this section, we first introduced our primary dataset we will be using for the next few sections.

    "- `SELECT` : \"Selects\" what to extract from the query. This clause can be followed by a specific variable name or by using \"*\" to select the whole table.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- `LIMIT` : Limits the number of rows from our query\n",
    "\n",
    "- `WHERE` : Filters the query on specific conditions. This clause can be combined with `AND` and `OR` clauses for more complex filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ORDER BY` : Sorts the output on variables in our query. This clause can include `DESC` to sort by descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "These clauses lay the foundation of `SQL`. They will be necessary for our next section, which will introduce aggregation functions. We showed a sneak peek of an aggregation function `COUNT()` in Question 3. More on that in the next section!\n",

    "#### A Little Extra\n",

    "As you may have noticed, SQL code is straight forward. It's clauses translate well to what you want SQL to do in natural verbal terms.
