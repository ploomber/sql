    "# Joining data in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "This section introduces a fundamental concept in SQL: <b>joining</b>. Joining is a powerful technique used to combine data from multiple tables based on their relationships. It allows you to supplement a dataset with additional information from another related dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show the capabilites of joining, we move away from the single bank dataset we initially used in this course. We will be incorporating several new datasets illustrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets we will be using originates from another bank's financial data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20180506061559/http://lisp.vse.cz/pkdd99/Challenge/chall.htm\n",
    "\n",
    "We first focus on just two datasets, the `account` and `district` dataset. To expedite our progress, we will skip the detailed explanation of each dataset's variables and dive straight into how joining works.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a comprehensive understanding of the data structure and attributes, please refer to the datasets' documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation: https://web.archive.org/web/20180506035658/http://lisp.vse.cz/pkdd99/Challenge/berka.htm\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a display of `account` and `district` in an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). \n",
    "\n",
    "![diagram](joining-data-ERD.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "ERDs are visual representations that help understand the relationship between two or more datasets. In an ERD, each table in the diagram represents a dataset. The variables of each dataset are represented as rows under each respective table. In our case, the first column of our table is the variable's name while the second column is the variable's value type. The notations of the line connecting our two tables indicate their relationship type and is defined as \"Crow's Foot Notation\". To learn more about this notation, we recommend visiting this article: https://vertabelo.com/blog/crow-s-foot-notation/\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists only two value types in the `accounts` and `district` table: \"INT\" and \"VARCHAR\". The \"INT\" value type indicates that the corresponding value is an integer, while \"VARCHAR\" represents a variable-length string that can contain various characters. These value types help SQL understand the appropriate operations that can be performed on each value. Alongside this, the second column of our tables also show if a variable is a primary key (PK) or foreign key (FK). We introduce these concepts below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a primary key and a foreign key?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a database, a <b>primary key</b> is a unique identifier for each record in a table. For instance, our `accounts` table has the primary key of \"account_id\". This makes sense because every single row in the `accounts` table corresponds to \"account_id\" which represents one single account. The `district` table has the primary key of \"District ID\". This means that each row under the `district` table represents one single district (or district id). So under the `accounts` table, there should not be any rows with the same \"account_id\" value. Similarly, the `district` table should not have any rows with the same \"district_id\" value. \n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key, on the other hand, establishes a relationship between two tables. It refers to the primary key of another table and helps connect the records across multiple tables. In our example, the \"district_id\" in the account table is a foreign key, indicating that it references the primary key of the district table. This allows us to associate each account with its corresponding district.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using primary and foreign keys, we establish relationships between tables, enabling us to perform joins and retrieve meaningful information by linking related data together. Let's jump straight into demonstrating these joins and how primary keys and foreign keys work.\n",

    "- `FULL JOIN` -  Guarantees that every row from both joined tables is included in the resulting query, regardless of whether a matching key exists in the other table or not. A `FULL JOIN` essentially combines the results of a `RIGHT JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `LEFT JOIN` - Guarantees that every row from the left table is included in the resulting query, regardless of whether a matching key exists in the other table or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `RIGHT JOIN` - Guarantees that every row from the right table is included in the resulting query, regardless of whether a matching key exists in the other table or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Primary key - The column in a table that uniquely identifies each row of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Foreign key - A column in a table that establishes a link or relationship to the primary key of another table.\n",
