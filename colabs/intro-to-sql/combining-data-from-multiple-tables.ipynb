    "## Combining Multiple Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "When combining more than two tables, it is imperative to know what the final result of our joins will look like. If we are familiar with the desired output before executing our queries, we can make an informed decision on whether to use an `INNER JOIN`, `OUTER JOIN`, or `FULL JOIN` to achieve our desired result. In short, assessing the case at hand will help us determine the type of join to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quickly refresh our memory from the previous tutorial on [`INNER JOIN`](https://ploomber-sql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro-to-sql/joining-data-in-sql.html#inner-join), recall that an `INNER JOIN` is suitable when we want to retrieve only the matching records, effectively filtering out any unmatched records, between the tables involved in the join. Therefore, the result will contain only the rows where the join condition is met in all the joined tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, an `OUTER JOIN` can be of three types: <b>Left, Right, and Full</b>. They were covered extensively in the [previous tutorial](https://ploomber-sql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro-to-sql/joining-data-in-sql.html#left-join), but here is a quick refresher. In situations where we need to retrieve all records from one table, regardless of whether there is a match in the other tables, an `OUTER JOIN` can be used. This is particularly useful when we want to <b>include supplementary information or handle missing data</b>. A `LEFT JOIN` includes all rows from the left table (the table specified before the LEFT JOIN keyword) and the matching rows from the right table(s) (the table(s) specified after the `LEFT JOIN` keyword). Similarly, a `RIGHT JOIN` includes all rows from the right table(s) and the matching rows from the left table. A `FULL JOIN` combines operations of both the `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`, including all rows from both tables and matching rows where the join condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, understanding the desired output and the relationships between the tables will help us determine whether an `INNER JOIN` or an `OUTER JOIN` is more appropriate for obtaining the desired result. By utilizing the appropriate join type and leveraging primary and foreign keys, we can combine data from multiple tables efficiently.\n",
