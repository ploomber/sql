    "In this tutorial, you will learn about Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in SQL and how they can simplify your code. CTEs are temporary result sets that you can reference within other `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements. They are a powerful tool for constructing complex queries in a readable and user-friendly way. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to create and use CTEs in your own SQL queries.\n",

    "The importance of checking the data before and after the operations is to verify that the operations were successful and only affected the intended data. It's generally not recommended to use UPDATE or DELETE without a unique identifier or precise condition to pinpoint exactly which rows you want to affect. Checking the data before and after helps to prevent or identify potential mistakes or unexpected results in the data modification process.\n",
