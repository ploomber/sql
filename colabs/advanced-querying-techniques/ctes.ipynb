    "In this tutorial, you will learn about Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in SQL and how they can simplify your code. CTEs are temporary result sets that you can reference within other `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements. They are a powerful tool for constructing complex queries in a readable and user-friendly way. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to create and use CTEs in your own SQL queries.\n",
