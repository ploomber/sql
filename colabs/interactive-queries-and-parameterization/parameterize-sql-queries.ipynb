    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this module, we have explored how to parameterize SQL queries and effectively integrate with Python for a more interactive data analysis workflow within Jupyter notebooks. This method is facilitated using JupySQL and DuckDB. We've also demonstrated how to dynamically create and use variables within SQL queries, further enhancing the flexibility and interactivity of the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We delved into the basics of variable expansion, using loops within SQL to iterate over arrays, and how to define and use macros to promote reusability and reduce redundancy. We further illustrated the potential of these techniques through several practical examples, including determining the top five oldest and youngest employees in various jobs, calculating average ages and balances by job and education level, handling `NULL` values with `macros`, and dynamically creating multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these exercises, it has been made evident that integrating SQL into Jupyter notebooks provides an intuitive and powerful approach to data exploration and analysis. The techniques demonstrated in this module can be widely applied across various datasets, making it a useful skillset for data scientists and analysts. By merging the strengths of Python's flexibility and SQL's data management capabilities, we can create more powerful and interactive data workflows.\n",

    "In the next section, you'll learn how to combine paramaterization with `ipywidgets`."
