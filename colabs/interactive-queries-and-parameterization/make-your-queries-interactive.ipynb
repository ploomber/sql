    "Consider the `pdays` variable from the bank marketing dataset. The value in this column is -1 when the client was not contacted since the previous campaign and an integer > 0 otherwise. The marketing manager wants you to create a macro named `dummify` that transforms this numeric variable into a binary categorical variable, named `pdays_dummy`, taking on either \"no\" if `pdays` = -1 or \"yes\" otherwise. You are also expected to create both a `RadioButtons` selection widget for the transformed `pdays_dummy` variable and a `SelectMultiple` selection widget for the `poutcome` variable to help the manager filter for campaign performance on the fly. Finally, output the rendered query after displaying the tabular results, with the columns `job`, `marital`, `poutcome`, and `pdays_dummy`.\n",

    "In this section, we learned about how to use JupySQL to create widgets with variable expansion and macros. To summarize:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numeric widgets, although commonly used as sliders, can also be used in text boxes or dropdowns, for example. This is useful when you want to specify a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For categorical or text data, we can use either Selection or Boolean widgets. Some examples include radio buttons, toggle buttons, and dropdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `%sql --interact {{widget_variable}}` is a powerful tool in your arsenal to quickly create `ipywidgets`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main difference between the `%sql` and `%%sql` magic commands in Jupyter notebooks is that `%sql` only allows for a single statement to be executed, while `%%sql` allows a block of SQL to be executed. Make sure to use `%%sql` when creating macros!\n",
    "\n",
    "- JupySQL provides incredible flexibility because it allows chaining `--` options, including `--save` and `--interact`, as we saw in this section. This helps us combine SQL queries with macros and widgets, making the EDA process less repetitive and more interactive!\n",
    "\n",
    "This ends the Interactive Queries and Parameterization module. We hope you use these skills to boost your productivity in creating interactive queries! In the next module, we will introduce Advanced Querying Techniques.\n",
